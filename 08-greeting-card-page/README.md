# Greeting Card Project ðŸŽ‰

A small HTML & CSS project to practice **pseudo-classes** and **pseudo-elements** while creating an interactive birthday greeting card.

## ðŸ“œ Project Overview
This project displays a styled greeting card with interactive links that:
- **Send** the card
- **Share** it on social media

When a link is clicked, a confirmation section appears for a few seconds and then disappears automatically using JavaScript.

## ðŸ–Œ Features & Learning Points
- **Pseudo-elements**:
  - `::before` and `::after` used to add emoji around the heading.
- **Pseudo-classes**:
  - `:hover` for card scaling and link color change.
  - `:active` for link pressed state.
  - `:focus` for link focus outline.
  - `:visited` for visited link color change.
  - `:target` for displaying the confirmation section when a link is clicked.
- **Transitions & transforms** for smooth hover effects.
- **JavaScript** to auto-hide sections after a short delay and clear the URL hash.
